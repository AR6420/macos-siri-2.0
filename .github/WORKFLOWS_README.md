# GitHub Actions Workflows

The following workflow files are available locally but cannot be auto-pushed due to GitHub App permissions:
- .github/workflows/build.yml - CI pipeline
- .github/workflows/release.yml - Release automation

To add these to your repository:
1. Manually copy these files to your GitHub repository via the web interface, or
2. Push from a local git client with appropriate permissions
